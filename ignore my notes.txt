these are great suggestions. Before we begin exploring possible features for addition and making significant changes, let's consider removing some of the less useful ones. For example:
```
    # Radio buttons for current_lesson type selection
    selected_lesson_type = st.sidebar.radio("Select Lesson Type", ["Instructions based lesson", "Interactive lesson with questions"])
```
is an artifact from previous versions. The user was able to chose the type of interaction with the teacher. It is no longer useful. I comment that line for debugging step, instead of directly removing it. After that, three errors " "selected_lesson_type" is not defined " arize regarding these two sections of the script:
1.

```
    def get_response(chain, user_input):
        response = chain(
            {"input": user_input, "chat_history": st.session_state.messages[-20:]},
            include_run_info=True,
            tags=[current_lesson.filename, selected_lesson_type]
        )
        return response
```

2.
```
    def initialize_state():
        if st.session_state.get("current_lesson") != selected_lesson_file or st.session_state.get("current_lesson_type") != selected_lesson_type:
            st.session_state["current_lesson"] = selected_lesson_file
            st.session_state["current_lesson_type"] = selected_lesson_type
            welcome_message = f"Once you are prepared, we shall begin our exploration of {selected_lesson_file}. I will be your guide throughout this intellectual journey."
            st.session_state["messages"] = [AIMessage(content=welcome_message)]
```

How do I remove this feature? How do I remove the "selected_lesson_type" variable from these sections of the script?
