# Section 1: The Sun's Composition
- Explanation: The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 75% of its mass) and helium (about 25%). It also contains trace amounts of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
- Example: Imagine a huge, glowing ball of mostly hydrogen and helium, with a sprinkling of other elements. That's our Sun!

# Section 2: The Sun's Structure
- Explanation: The Sun has several layers: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the corona in the atmosphere.
- Example: Think of the Sun as an onion, with different layers that each play a unique role in making the Sun what it is.

# Section 3: The Sun's Importance to Earth
- Explanation: The Sun is the primary source of Earth's heat and light. It drives weather patterns and ocean currents. It also emits particles that can affect satellite communications and power grids on Earth.
- Example: Without the Sun, life as we know it on Earth would not exist. It's like the ultimate power source, driving many of the processes that make our planet habitable.
