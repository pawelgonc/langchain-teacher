# Coal
- Explanation: Coal is a significant resource in Poland, accounting for about 25% of all raw materials extracted. With documented resources of over 50 billion tons, Poland ranks among the top 10 countries in annual production. It's used as fuel in power plants and homes, and as a raw material in the chemical and steel industries.
- Example: The main areas where you can find coal are the Upper Silesian Coal Basin and the Lublin Coal Basin.

# Sulfur
- Explanation: Poland's native sulfur resources amount to over 500 million tons. Interestingly, Poland is the last country in the world to extract this raw material from underground instead of using other methods. That's why it's also the leader in world production, with over half a million tons per year.
- Example: Deposits of sulfur can be found near Tarnobrzeg, Szydłowiec, and Lubaczów.
